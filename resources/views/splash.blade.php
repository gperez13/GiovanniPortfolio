                    I am passionate about building web applications for clients in fast-growing, human-centered industries, 
                    including FinTech, Higher Education, Healthcare, and Government. I specialize in Outsystems, Swift, and 
                    PHP development. While I have modified my PHP stack to include Laravel, Vue.js, MySQL, & Forge, I remain 
                    language and framework agnostic and am comfortable adapting to project requirements. I take pride in 
                    working to cultivate a working environment conducive to trust, compassion, and joy by actively sharing 
                    my vulnerabilities.
